## What is a container, and why is Docker used for containers?

A container is a lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient package of software that includes everything needed to run an application. It's like a virtual machine but without the full operating system overhead, making it more efficient and faster to deploy. Docker helps you create, manage, and deploy these containers efficiently. You can think of Docker as a tool that helps you create the cargo and load it onto ships.
